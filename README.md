# react-tic-tac-toe
Tic tac toe is a fun game and with this assignment you will learn the basics of a react-redux application

## What to do

Its quite simple, create a tic-tac-toe both played by computer and 2nd player. For reference check ![this](https://playtictactoe.org/) out.

Use React as the view and controller layer and Redux as the data layer. Features to be added:
1. Should be single page app with no reloads
2. Should have a reset button to reset the game at any momnent.
3. Should show Next player -> X or O
4. Should show all previous state and an option to toggle to it. For reference check ![this](https://harman052.github.io/react-tutorial-solutions/)

#### If you think you are a pro add this as well
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) 
2. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win
3. Make the UI to look good. Try to add some transitions to make it attractive.

## Available Scripts

Your have add these script in your project directory 

### npm run dev
Runs the app in the development mode using ![webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
The page should reload if you make edits. Implement hot module reload functionality from webpack
See the section about ![deployment](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/) for more information.

### npm run build 
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build should be minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about ![deployment](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/) for more information.
